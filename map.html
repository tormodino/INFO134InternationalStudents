              The Academic Quarter, also called the Quarter, is the student's
              cultural center in Bergen. The name is a word game, as academic
              quarter is traditionally the name in which circles formed have
              put on delays that one should look through the fingers, while a
              quartet means a quarter. Every year there are a large number of
              events in the neighborhood, ranging from board games to concerts.

              Garage is a bar with hangout in Bergen (previously a department
              also in Oslo, see below) with its own concert department.
              The Bergens department was founded in 1990 by veterans in the
              Bergens rock environment, had from the beginning of the rock
              profile and soon became one of the city's most popular nightlife,
              especially among students. Due to municipal rules on opening
              hours, the bar room was divided into two separate departments
              with different opening hours for several years.

              Club Inside started in 2nd set in 2003 and soon established itself
              as a "slightly different" night out in the heart of Bergen.
              Inside Rock cafe opened its doors in the 1st of the fall of 2004
              and was soon one of the mountain's most popular places for those
              who were fond of rock.
              Our music is and has been guitar based, something we will always
              have as a red thread. Inside has been visited by many great
              artists / bands and we have received a lot of praise for the
              concept, as well as our food.
              If you are visiting and want to impress friends, we recommend
              that you try an "Inside" shot. This swirls with 1.2 million

              Fløyfjellet or Fløyen is one of Bergen's most popular mountain
              attractions, and one of Bergen's most popular tourist attractions.
              The view of Bergen from the viewpoint at Fløyen station
              Fløyfjellet is first and foremost the name of the mountain top,
              which is 400 meters above sea level and is located directly above
              Bergen city center. The name may be from the whistle bar, a
              windshield or weather rack that was raised to give a signal of
              the wind direction when ships were to leave Vågen. The view of the
              mountain peninsula makes Fløyfjellet a popular destination for
              both tourists and the local people. The Fløyfjellet is also a
              hiking trail that runs in a loop from Fløien station.
